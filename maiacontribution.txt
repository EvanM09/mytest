I'm running out of weird things to add to peoples repositories. I'm sorry. You get the weird tadpole song from that one episode of the muppets. 

Julie Andrews

When you were a tadpole and I was a fish, 
when the whole world had barely begun
I saw you swim by with a smile in your eye, 
and I loved you from that moment on

And through all the changes, from fins into fingers, 
I longed for the day you would be the sweet, 
loving person you've finally become from that faraway day in the sea, 
and my first wish...

That you would love me too, 

I'm so glad that you lovе me to 
'cause I've loved you 
since you were a tadpole and i was a...guess what?


Kermit

A fish?


Julie Andrews

A fish


Note: Right she sang this song to Kermit.
